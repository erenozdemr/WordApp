Word App is a mobile application developed using Kotlin and Android Studio. This project allows you to note down the meanings of English words, record the meaning and usage examples of the word you want, and improve your pronunciation skills by listening to them aloud. It also supports you to learn English with a quiz and a mixed card game created from the words you have noted. Thanks to the AI chat section, you can chat in English simultaneously.

Below you can find the technologies and components used:

API: API integration was provided to send and receive data using Retrofit and OkHttp.

Room Database: Room database was used to store users' word lists locally.

MVVM Architecture Pattern: Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architectural pattern was used.

Coroutines: Kotlin coroutines were used to manage asynchronous operations.

Navigation: Android Navigation Component was used to manage screen transitions.

LiveData: LiveData was used to provide data flow between ViewModel and View.

These technologies and components help Word App provide a powerful, efficient and user-friendly experience.
